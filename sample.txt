1. Introduction

> "Good [morning/afternoon], I am Stephen J, from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
Today, Iâ€™m going to present my MERN Stack project titled â€˜Online Exam Registration Systemâ€™.
This project allows students to register for their semester exams digitally and helps admins manage and track registrations."




---

ðŸ”¹ 2. Problem Statement / Purpose

> "In most colleges, exam registration is still done manually or through basic forms with no central tracking system.
My project solves this by providing a centralized, user-friendly, and secure platform where students can register for exams, and admins can manage those registrations efficiently."




---

ðŸ”¹ 3. Project Overview (Functionality)

> "This is a full-stack web application with two types of users:



Students â€“ who can log in, view available exams, and register

Admins â€“ who can view all registrations, approve/reject them, and manage exams
All operations like adding exams, registering students, and viewing reports are performed through a user-friendly UI."

ðŸ”¹ 4. Technology Stack (MERN)

> "I used the MERN Stack for this project:



MongoDB â€“ to store student, exam, and registration data

Express.js â€“ to build RESTful APIs

React.js â€“ to create the frontend UI

Node.js â€“ to handle the backend logic"
